# Lena is preparing for an important coding competition that is preceded by a number of sequential preliminary contests. Initially, her luck balance is 0. She believes in "saving luck", and wants to check her theory. Each contest is described by two integers, L[i] and T[i]:
# - L[i] is the amount of luck associated with a contest. If Lena wins the contest, her luck balance will decrease by L[i] if she loses it, her luck balance will increase by L[i].
# T[i] denotes the contest's importance rating. It's equal to 1 if the contest is important, and it's equal to 0 if it's unimportant.
# If Lena loses no more than k important contests, what is the maximum amount of luck she can have after competing in all the preliminary contests? This value may be negative.
# Example
# k = 2
# L = [5,1,4]
# T = [1,1,0]
# Contest		L[i]	T[i]
# 1		    5	    1
# 2		    1	    1
# 3		    4	    0
# If Lena loses all of the contests, her will be 5+1+4=10. Since she is allowed to lose 2 important contests, and there are only 2 important contests, she can lose all three contests to maximize her luck at 10.
# If k=1, she has to win at least 1 of the 2 important contests. She would choose to win the lowest value important contest worth 1. Her final luck will be 5+4-1=8.

# Function Description
# Complete the luckBalance function in the editor below.
# luckBalance has the following parameter(s):
# - int k: the number of important contests Lena can lose
# - int contests[n][2]: a 2D array of integers where each contest[i] contains two integers that represent the luck balance and importance of the ith contest

# Returns
# int: the maximum luck balance achievable

# Input Format
# The first line contains two space-separated integers n and k, the number of preliminary contests and the maximum number of important contests Lena can lose.
# Each of the next n lines contains two space-separated integers, L[i] and T[i], the contest's luck balance and its importance rating.

# Constraints
# 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
# 0 ≤ k ≤ n
# 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ 10^4
# T[i] ∈ {0,1}
