# Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
# For example, the square matrix is shown below:
#     1 2 3
#     4 5 6
#     9 8 9
# The left-to-right diagonal = 1+5+9=15. The right to left diagonal = 3+5+9=17. Their absolute difference is |15-17|=2.

# Function description
# Complete the diagonalDifference function in the editor below.
# diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:
# - int arr[n][m]: an array of integers

# Return
# - int: the absolute diagonal difference

# Input Format
# The first line contains a single integer, n, the number of rows and columns in the square matrix arr.
# Each of the next n lines describes a row, arr[i], and consists of n space-separated integers arr[i][j].

# Constraints
# -100 ≤ arr[i][j] ≤ 100

# Output Format
# Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.

# Sample Input
#     3
#     11 2 4
#     4 5 6
#     10 8 - 12

# Sample Output
#     15

# Explanation
# The primary diagonal is :
# 11
#    5
#      -12

# Sum across the primary diagonal: 11 + 5 - 12 = 4
# The secondary diagonal is :
#      4
#    5
# 10

# Sum across the secondary diagonal: 4 + 5 + 10 = 19
# Difference: |4 - 19| = 15

# Note: |x| is the absolute value of x
