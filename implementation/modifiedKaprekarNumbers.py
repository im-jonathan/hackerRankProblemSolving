# A modified Kaprekar number is a positive whole number with a special property. If you square it, then split the number into two integers and sum those integers, you have the same value you started with.
# Consider a positive whole number n with d digits. We square n to arrive at a number that is either 2xd digits long or (2xd)-1 digits long. Split the string representation of the square into two parts, l and r. The right hand part, r must be l digits long. The left is the remaining substring. Convert those two substrings back to integers, add them and see if you get n.

# Example
# n = 5
# d = 1
# First calculate that n ^ 2 = 25. Split that into two strings and convert them back to integers 2 and 5. Test 2 + 5 = 7 â‰  5, so this is not a modified Kaprekar number. If n = 9, still d = 1, and n^2 = 81. This gives us 8 + 1 = 9, the original n.
# Note: r may have leading zeros.

# Given two positive integers p and q where p is lower than q, write a program to print the modified Kaprekar numbers in the range between p and q, inclusive. If no modified Kaprekar numbers exist in the given range, print INVALID RANGE.

# Function Description
# Complete the kaprekarNumbers function in the editor below.

# kaprekarNumbers has the following parameter(s):
# - int p: the lower limit
# - int q: the upper limit

# Prints
# It should print the list of modified Kaprekar numbers, space-separated on one line and in ascending order. If no modified Kaprekar numbers exist in the given range, print INVALID RANGE. No return value is required.

# Input Format
# The first line contains the lower integer limit p.
# The second line contains the upper integer limit q.
# Note: Your range should be inclusive of the limits.

# Constraints
# 0 < p < q < 100000

# Sample Input
#     STDIN   Function
#     ----- --------
#     1       p = 1
#     100     q = 100

# Sample Output
#     1 9 45 55 99
