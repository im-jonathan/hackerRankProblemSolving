# We define a magic square to be an nxn matrix of distinct positive integers from 1 to n^2 where the sum of any row, column, or diagonal of length n is always equal to the same number: the magic constant.
# You will be given a 3x3 matrix s of integers in the inclusive range [1, 9]. We can convert any digit a to any other digit b in the range [1, 9] at cost of |a -b|. Given s, convert it into a magic square at minimal cost. Print this cost on a new line.
# Note: The resulting magic square must contain distinct integers in the inclusive range[1, 9].

# Example
# s = [[5, 3, 4], [1, 5, 8], [6, 4, 2]]

# The matrix looks like this:
#     5 3 4
#     1 5 8
#     6 4 2
# We can convert it to the following magic square:
#     8 3 4
#     1 5 9
#     6 7 2
# This took three replacements at a cost of |5-8|+|8-9|+|4-7| = 7.

# Function Description
# Complete the formingMagicSquare function in the editor below.
# formingMagicSquare has the following parameter(s):
# - int s[3][3]: a 3x3 array of integers

# Returns
# int: the minimal total cost of converting the input square to a magic square

# Input Format
# Each of the 3 lines contains three space-separated integers of row s[i].

# Constraints
# s[i][j] âˆˆ [1, 9]

# Sample Input 0
#     4 9 2
#     3 5 7
#     8 1 5

# Sample Output 0
#     1

# Explanation 0
# If we change the bottom right value, s[2][2], from 5 to 6 at a cost of |6 - 5| = 1, s becomes a magic square at the minimum possible cost.

# Sample Input 1
#     4 8 2
#     4 5 7
#     6 1 6

# Sample Output 1
#     4

# Explanation 1
# Using 0-based indexing, if we make
# s[0][1] -> 9 at a cost of |9-8|=1
# s[1][0] -> 3 at a cost of |3-4|=1
# s[2][0] -> 8 at a cost of |8-6|=2,
# then the total cost will be 4.
